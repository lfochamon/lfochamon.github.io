<h1 class="post-title">What should I put on my academic website?</h1>
<span class="post-date">Feb 14, 2022</span>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Let's start by refreshing our memory on the "only" 4 reasons academics will go to
your website (for more details, read the <a href="#">full post</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>they heard your name and need to find out if you're worth their time;</li>
<li>you are about to or in the middle of giving a talk;</li>
<li>they have to meet with you;</li>
<li>they are looking for a specific paper you wrote.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the <a href="#">basic</a> needs your website must serve. So at the very least you
should have: a picture, a formal bio, your CV, a list of publications,
and your contact information. Once you have these covered, and whenever you feel
like it, you can go and add some of the <a href="#">extras</a> (informal bio, research summary,
teaching, personal interests, blog...).</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2>
<h3 id="picture">Picture</h3>
<p>You should display a nice (recent!) picture of yourself so people can recognize you.
It doesn't have to be a professional shot, but it should look professional. So perhaps
you can skip that cropped pictures from a night out or that costume shot from a music
festival. Naturally, this picture is part of <em>your</em> brand, so if it makes sense to
feature pets, a caricature, or a shot in nature, go for it! But try to have at least
one picture with your face clearly visible in the main section of your page. After all
the point of this picture is also for people to be able to recognize you.</p>
<h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>
<p>You will need a "formal bio." That's a third person biography that summarizes your
academic career. Make sure it is easily accessible: this is what the busy person
about to introduce you will be desperately looking for minutes before your talk begins.
The typical format is (see <a href="https://www.luizchamon.com/pages/formal-bio.html">mine</a> for a concrete example):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Full name</code> received the <code>degree</code> from <code>institution</code> in <code>year</code> [repeat for each degree].
He/she/they is/are currently <code>position</code> at <code>institution</code>.
In <code>year</code>, he/she/they was/were <code>position</code> at <code>company</code> [list professional experience].
In <code>year</code>, he/she/they received <code>award</code> [list awards].
His/her/their research interests include <code>research interests</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the IEEE recommended format. But you should check out the bios of a few
prominent researchers in your field to gauge what your bio should look like.
For STEM, it won't deviate too much from this. Stick this on your homepage next
to your picture and you are done (or you can develop your story a bit <a href="#">further</a>).</p>
<h3 id="cv">CV</h3>
<p>This is another thing that for some reason is consistently missing from academic
websites. Include a link to a <code>pdf</code> version of your <em>academic CV</em>. This is not
a résumé! It is meant to be longer and more comprehensive. It should
contain your education history, research and teaching experiences,
awards and fellowships, professional experiences, and a full list of publications.
I plan on writing a more detailed post on the academic CV in the future. Certainly
not too soon, just because there are already plenty of resources on this topic.
And you're a researcher, so you know... Research!</p>
<h3 id="list-of-publications">List of publications</h3>
<p>If you have publications (or preprints), have a list of them with links to the papers.
Make those papers accessible, i.e., avoid linking versions behind paywalls.
That means arXiv, bioRxiv, or a self-hosted <code>pdf</code>. Most publications will allow you to
share your own version of the paper, but do check your publisher's website to make
sure you are not violating any of their restrictions.</p>
<p>If you don't have publications, it's OK. Just leave that spot ready for your
soon-to-come first paper. On rare occasions I have seen researchers feature a
work-in-progress manuscript. But if your results are not very close to prime time
you run the serious risk of getting scooped. Food for thought...</p>
<h3 id="contact-information">Contact information</h3>
<p>Finally, you should specify the different ways people can get in touch with you.
Typically, that means your email (preferably the one you got from your institution,
although your Gmail is fine too) and perhaps your office address (this makes it easier
for students to find you if and when you become a teaching assistant or start mentoring).
You should also feature links to your profiles on Google Scholar and, if relevant,
GitHub, YouTube... Wherever you have a professional, academic presence. In other words,
link the YouTube channel that hosts videos of your talks or experiments and not cats!</p>
<h2 id="the-extras">The extras</h2>
<p>You do not need anything beyond <a href="#">the basics</a>. And you can just type that all into a single page,
it's become very trendy in the world of <a href="#">web design</a>. As time goes by, however,
you might want to make your web page a bit more informative. Although these additions are
completely optional, they are not useless. The pages with the most views and lengthier
engagement on my website are the <a href="https://www.luizchamon.com/pages/research.html">research summary</a>
and <a href="https://www.luizchamon.com/pages/about.html">informal bio</a> (<a href="#">Figure 1</a>). But they are vacuous
if you don't have <a href="#">the basics</a> covered.</p>

User data for my website during February 2022{: .caption}</p>
<p>Here are some ideas on how to extend your website:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Other bios</strong>: feature an informal bio telling a more stylized story of your
    career (see for instance my <a href="https://www.luizchamon.com/pages/about.html">about page</a>).
    A considerable number of people do tend to spend some time reading it (certainly
    much more time than braving the dry land of your formal bio). I'd also recommend
    that you eventually move all these longer texts away from your front page, replacing
    them by a one-or-two-lines blurb that summarizes you (as on my
    <a href="https://www.luizchamon.com/index.html">homepage</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research description</strong>: as you move through graduate school and academia, you'll
    eventually get a good idea of what your research is about. At that moment, you
    might want to write a short summary of it on your website. This is an opportunity
    for you to articulate a broader vision your research is pursuing, to discuss
    the forest rather than the trees. So the goal is not to summarize a
    specific paper (that's what the abstract is for!), but to tie some of your papers
    together into a cohesive story. You can break them into projects
    <a href="https://www.luizchamon.com/pages/research.html">as I did</a> or just write it all in a single paragraph.
    However, if you want people to read it, make it short and to the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal interests</strong>: I used to think this page was useless, but apparently some people
    do read this (<a href="#">Figure 1</a>). There are no rules here, feel free to be yourself and
    show more of who you are as a person. Some people include books they like, hobbies,
    causes they are passionate about... Really, anything goes. Just keep in mind that even though
    your research is not judged based on your personality (or at least, it is not supposed
    to be), you definitely are. So if you decide to include controversial or downright
    offensive views, it will negatively affect your professional image. Remember
    that while the page is called <em>"personal,"</em> this is still your <em>professional</em> website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teaching</strong>: if you have taught courses, written materials for classes, or have
    received positive feedback from students or mentees, you could collect them in a
    <a href="https://www.luizchamon.com/pages/teaching.html">page</a> on your website. The idea is to showcase
    that you are not only a great researcher, but also a great teacher.
    Many starting their PhDs or careers will not have that much solo teaching
    experience and will simply have a short list of courses they have assisted a
    professor with. That's more than enough!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blog</strong>: more and more academics blog about a variety of topics connected to their
    research. This could be a new paper, a new avenue of research, class notes,
    an opinion piece, or some interesting piece of math or science. Some of these
    are extremely good and thought-provoking, others are just violently boring.
    As a junior academic (graduate student, young researcher), I think your writing
    time is better spent writing papers (or learning to do so). But then again,
    here I am blogging... so what do I know?!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-about-twitter-youtube-facebook-instagram-snapchat-tiktok">What about Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok...?</h2>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: as a junior academic (graduate student, young researcher), your time is
always better spent writing papers. Now, on to a little rant...</p>
<p>A growing number of academics have a professional presence on social media platforms,
mainly Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Fortunately, dancing academics are not yet
trending on TikTok and the fraction of professors Snapchating about papers remains
small (zero?!). But there are voices out there claiming this is the future and
that soon, having a website will not be enough. Academics no longer have the time
or attention span to read full papers and if you want to succeed, you need to
have bite-sized, intuitive, non-technical explanations of your work available.</p>
<p>I want to strongly refute this argument. To be clear, I don't mean these platforms
cannot be useful for academics: if you prefer engaging 150 characters at a time,
then by all means do so! But the idea that academia should be providing bite-sized,
intuitive, non-technical rendering of their advances is ludicrous. Advanced research
takes time and work. If you are doing (or have done) a PhD, you are (painfully) aware
of that. It involves gathering, absorbing, and synthesizing a large amount of information
and techniques in order to make small dents in the boundaries of current knowledge.
As a consequence, the results of this research often hold under a complex web of
assumptions whose implications must be carefully understood. The idea that there
is a way to convey this information in a <a href="#">10-minutes TED talk</a> is absurd.</p>
<p>That is not to say that academia should serve itself or be detached from the
public. Your work impacts society (hopefully in a positive way), so
anyone should have access to understand it and its consequences. And it is part of
your job to explain your research to the general public in a way that is accessible,
yet does not misrepresent your results. All I am arguing is that this is a different
job than the one of communicating with your peers. So the language, the media,
the approach are inevitably different.</p>
<p>Plowing through dense, technical papers takes time and effort. Especially considering
how poorly written they often are (that's a different issue). But this is what
is needed to make progress.</p>
