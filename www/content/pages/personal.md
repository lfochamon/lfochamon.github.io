I love writing and playing music. I play several musical instruments
to varying degrees of success. Mainly the piano, the accordion,
and the acoustic guitar. But I also pretend to play
the violin, the flute, and typical Brazilian percussion instruments,
such as the zabumba and the triangle. I used to play the accordion in a *forró* band named
[Quaraçá](https://soundcloud.com/luiz-chamon/sets/quaraca), meaning sun ray or
sun light in a Brazilian indigenous language. *Forró* is a folk music genre
from the Northeast of Brazil that I somehow still manage to dance in the US
(well, before 2020).

I worked in many recording studios back in Brazil (most small, some even smaller),
which is actually how I got into electrical engineering and signal processing. Earlier during the pandemic,
I went back to recording some music in my bedroom. You can listen to some
of it at [LFO Chamon](https://www.lfochamon.com).

More recently, I made a guest appearance in one of my friend's YouTube channel
singing (if you can call that "singing") one of my favorite Greek songs.

Besides music, I also like reading and learning about different cultures and languages.
I pretend to know some psychology (nothing clinical) and philosophy,
particularly philosophy of science and probability. I've also been pretending to
speak Greek for a couple of years now. I don't always pretend very well.

I am part of a group of soccer lovers that created the [Philadelphia
Open Soccer](https://www.philadelphiaopensoccer.org/) (or on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/phillyopensoccer/)), a program that
teaches soccer to kids in public schools of West Philadelphia. We have
grown a lot this past couple of years with new volunteers and started a
program geared towards immigrants and refugees in
[Northeast Philadelphia](https://www.facebook.com/pg/phillyopensoccer/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1299783973460905).

Although I don't take soccer as seriously as you'd expect from a
Brazilian, I do like watching the *Seleção* (Brazilian national team).
I understand if right now the thought of mentioning the 2014 7-1 fiasco against
Germany crossed your mind. Let me get back to you when your national team also manages to win five World Cups...
