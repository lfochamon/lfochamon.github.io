# Prospective members

My group designs systems to extract, process, and act on information using tools from
optimization, signal processing, control, learning, and probability (not always all of them, not necessarily all at once).
If this is something you're interested in, consider joining us in one of the following ways:

- [Postdoc](#postdoc)
- [PhD student](#phd-student)
- [Master thesis](#master-thesis)
- [Student assistant](#student-assistant)

&nbsp;

## PhD student

{#
I do not have any PhD position calls open at the moment.
But feel free to [reach out](mailto&#58;{{SITEEMAIL}}?subject=[App PhD]) to discuss if you are interested in working with me.
I am always willing to consider outstanding students to join my group.
#}

<div class='highlight' markdown=1>
I am currently looking for people interested in joining my group as a PhD student to work on topics at the intersection of optimization, learning, and statistics.
Example projects include, but are certainly not limited to,

- Science-constrained learning
- Resilience in learning and control
- Ascent-descent dynamics in optimization and sampling
{# - Rethinking generalization as a learning requirements #}

Also feel free to [apply](#how-to-apply) if you are interested in any other direction of my research.

Projects in my group are typically at the interface of theory and practice, so there is room for those more mathematically-inclined as well as those
more empirically-inclined. While all of my students are expected to know and do a bit of both, there are opportunities for you to position
yourself along a wide range of the theory/math&ndash;practice/coding spectrum.

**Deadline**: applications are accepted on a rolling basis (positions will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found).  
**Target starting date:** Spring 2023 (flexible)  
**Duration:** 3.5 years (initial contract)  
**Salary:** 100% TV-L E13 ([What?!](#so-how-much-is-e13-exactly))  

If you have any questions about the positions and/or life in Germany, do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto&#58;{{SITEEMAIL}}?subject=[App PhD]).

### Additional information


#### Why pursue your PhD here?

At the University of Stuttgart and SimTech, you have access to a world-class research infrastructure and support,
including high performance computing clusters and scientific data infrastructures. You also have the opportunity&nbsp;(and means)
to interact with leading scientists from a variety of fields; sit on seminars from noteworthy researchers from around the world;
and attend major conferences.

On the&nbsp;(not-less-important) logistic side, while Germany is known for its bureaucracy,
the requirements for PhD positions here are actually quite straightforward. In particular,

- you are *not* required to take German language exams, TOEFL, GRE, or pay application fees;
- there are *no starting date* restrictions: you can begin your PhD year-round;
- you have the opportunity to take courses, but are *not* required to do so;
- there are *no teaching* requirements;
- PhD programs tend to be shorter (3-4 years), though this is not a rule.

Additionally, you enjoy several benefits, such as

- competitive [compensation](#so-how-much-is-e13-exactly);
- full-time employment by the university that entitles you to social benefits,
  including healthcare, family assistance, and 30 days of paid time-off (holidays);
- fully-funded opportunities to attend conferences.

If you have any questions about the positions, the PhD in general, and/or life in Germany, do not hesitate to
[reach out](mailto&#58;{{SITEEMAIL}}?subject=[App PhD]).


#### So how much is E13 exactly?

PhD student salaries are negotiated nationally by the worker's association. You can easily find *gross* values on
[this](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/tv-l/allg/) government website. *Net* salaries are harder to determine as they
depend on things like years within the PhD, marital status, whether you have kids, what kind of health insurance you choose...
In an informal poll of *net* salaries among PhD students, I got to an average of **2300&nbsp;â‚¬** (which is consistent with
[this tier](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/allg?id=tv-l&g=E_13&s=1&zv=VBL&z=100&zulage=&stkl=1&r=&zkf=&kk=15.5%25)).
You can compare that with whatever you find when typing `cost of living stuttgart` on Google (with the typical caveat on internet sources).

It is worth noting that PhD students in Germany are full-time employees of the university entitled to social benefits
(healthcare, pension plans, family assistance, etc.), sick days, and 30 days of paid time-off&nbsp;(holidays) per year.

Again, if you have any questions about the positions, the PhD in general, and/or life in Germany, do not hesitate to
[reach out](mailto&#58;{{SITEEMAIL}}?subject=[App PhD]).


#### Do I need to speak German?

The answer is a resounding **NO**. The official and working language of the group is English (the same holds for ELLIS and SimTech).
Additionally, the majority of graduate course are offered in English and most of the university staff speaks English.
I myself do not currently speak German and I'm surviving.

Now, *should* you speak German? Probably eventually. Even if Stuttgart is a highly international city (more than 25% of its
population has a foreign passport), speaking German will definitely make your life easier and more fun outside of the university.
And if you are going to spend multiple years in a country, you might as well learn the local language. If you do decide to
give German a try, the university and the city offer a variety of German language courses and resources, many of them free of charge.

Visitors/Exchanges

I am honored to host self-funded visitors in my lab and will support their effort to secure required funding. In my experience, both the host and visitor are most productive if the terms and the program of the research visit are discussed ahead of time. Please email me at dvorkin@nyu.edu so we can discuss the matter.
