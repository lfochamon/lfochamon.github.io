title: How to write math
date: 2022-02-14
summary: Short version for index and feeds
status: draft

- This is not about proof techniques, but about how to write a mathematical manuscript
- Disclaimer: I am not a mathematician
- Disclaimer: this is not meant for mathematicians (though they could find it useful), they might do it differently
- Always check-in with your field's culture/research program
- Theorem, explanation, proof
- Not a fan of the "informal statement": theorems are formal, explanations need not be (but still, stick to the facts!)
- Always interpret and contextualize results
- Explain what you're gonna do, do it, explain what you've done
- NO LONG CHAINS OF EQUATIONS/INEQUALITIES: be verbose!
- Try to avoid dealing with the arcane math terminology: just define things! (don't do like wiki)
- Always be specific about what you're referencing (no "the previous equation," "the inequality above")

> Sloppy presentation is simply NOT ACCEPTABLE. If your presentation is not professionally executed,
  it is almost impossible to tell if your arguments are correct. Bizarrely enough, it's just like Mother said:
  "Neatness counts!" When the time comes to write real (publishable!) papers,
  you'll find huge benefits to knowing how to write your proofs clearly and honestly.

> As I remind myself of what Rick has written, I note that he has a little tendency to prove a more general result and then collect simpler (more natural!) results as corollaries. For for example, he does the WLLN for triangular arrays before he does it for IID sequences.  
> I'd coach you to go the other way.  
> State the simplest version of the "theorem" that makes sense and prove that version first. Then look at your proof to see if you can extract from your proof: (1) a more general or (2) more precise version of your theorem.  
> I'd speculate that most "general theorems" are just simple theorems followed by some conscientious "proof mining". It's not a bold claim to assert that is the way that the world came to most of its collection of general results. Hilbert said that the path to mathematical discovery was through those examples that carry the germ of generality.  
> If you are interested in making your own contributions, I'd say that the "simple" to "general" path is the only way to go. The only caveat is that the words "simple" and "general" have many layers of interpretations. At this point --- why not take the simplest!  
> Look at the look at Tao's note on concentration. Tao's view of the Hoeffding inequalities was very instructive to me. I had Hoeffding in my head as a "convexity result" and I was honestly surprised to see that a useful version could be had by a crude Taylor series method. This is obvious once seen, but I never asked myself the question: "Can I just get by with an expansion?" By golly, the next time I see some convexity proof, I will ask myself that question.  
> The great benefit of a crude method is that it tends to be very robust. Tao's approach to Hoeffding makes inevitable the inequalities of Bennett and Bernstein (coming soon to a class room near you).  
> PS: There may not be any real ordering of ideas from complex to simple. It's certainly open to discussion whether a convexity argument is more fundamental than a Taylor series argument. Much of the time I'd side with convexity as being the simpler.As they say in the negotiations classes: "Why not both?" The two methods have robustness of differing kinds, so "proof mining" can lead from them in different directions.
