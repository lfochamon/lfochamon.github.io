title: Topic list
status: draft

  1. Things that can crush your soul as a scientist/PhD
    - Feel like there's no momentum, no sense of growth
      * People are not reading your papers
      * People are not citing your papers
      * You just gave a conference talk to 2 people (one of which was the chair)
      * Happens every few years or so, there's some sort of cycles here too
      * Change approaches:
        - stop with conferences, go to journal
        - give departmental talks, group meetings, reach out
    - No success metrics
      * Low citations
      * Terrible google scholar
      * Lame numbers
      * You need to know what you're shooting for, but be careful with vanity metrics (numbers are not a measure of your worth)
    - Bad reviews, negative comments
      * You could have gotten 1000 papers, an award, that one bad review will ruining you
      * If this is happening consistently, maybe there's a self-assessment needed there :P
    - You have no new ideas
    - You have budget issues
      * Happens all the time in research and can make things move slowly
      * It can be really demotivating
      * Don't sit on your thumbs: go find an alternative project (simulation?)
    - You have no connections
      * Not hip and cool to know the right people
      * Shy and can't make connections
      * There's no one around you to meet (virtual conferences, outsider in a scientific community)
      * Science is a relationship business
      * Talk to other students: low stakes, not a lot to lose, and good way to practice connections
      * Also, students become professors or important people
      * Make genuine connections though, don't be a dick
      * We're all awkward but try not to be weird: social cues are cultural, but try to be on the safe side.
        But don't use that as an excuse to procrastinate!

  20. Set the agenda or it will be set for you

  21. Some unfortunate turn of events
    - The benchmark mindset
    - The publish or perish mindset
    - The arXiv (blog?!) promotion
    - The short memory (no need to site this old crap!)

  7. How to write a paper
    - Research programs
    - Papers are like music (my friend says, Bethoveen 5th): every part has a sound and rhythm
    - [Rota 1](https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf)
    - [Rota 2](https://people.math.osu.edu/nevai.1/MYMATH/PUBLICATIONS/rota_letter_ams_notices_03_97.html)
    - Publication strategy
    - [ACS tips](https://acsoncampus.acs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ACSonC_10tips_Science-Writing_Poster_2020-v1.pdf)
    - [English writing tips](https://nanohub.org/resources/7880/download/2009.10.29-Keating-NT501.pdf)

  22. Do you have a publication strategy?
    - How are your papers connected?
    - Where are you trying to go?
    - What's the vision of this line of research?
    - How many papers is that idea?
      - Salami slicing
    - What's the appropriate audience?

  24. Mentoring students
    - Graduate students
      * Year 1: help them navigate the expectations of the program, its requirements,
      and introducing basic academic reading and writing skills.
        - Summer: first small research project
      * Year 2: finish classes, gear up research (submit first conference paper), and
      start working on first journal
        - Summer: submit first journal
      * Year 3: start on main project (working towards the dissertation theme)
        - Summer: submit second journal or ML conference
      * Year 4: explore extensions of main project in another journal
      (student now pitches their own ideas)
        - Summer: submit one journals and ML conference
      * Year 5: continue publications, thesis writing, and job market preparation
        - Summer: submit two journals and ML conference

  23. Dealing with interviews
    - Have a goal (set the agenda or it will be set for you)
    - Write 2 or 3 core messages towards that goal and stick to them!
    - Have a 2-3 min introduction describing what motivated you to apply and what would make a difference in terms of attracting you
    - Prepare answers to typical questions
      - Dissertation (previous research)
      - Describe a key contribution you have made so far to your field.
      - Research plan
      - Publication plan for the next 5 years
      - Teaching plan
      - Describe real world applications that motivate your research
      - Graduate student mentoring
      - Who do you see yourself collaborating with and why
      - What are your views on the state of the art of your field and key research challenges for the next five years?
        How does your research agenda align with those challenges?
      - Do you have any questions for us?
        * What is the teaching load and the breakdown of undergraduate and graduate teaching?
        * Do you provide junior sabbaticals for assistant professors?
        * I heard that MINDS is developing undergraduate and graduate degrees dedicated to the mathematical foundations of data science. Could you tell me more about that?
        * I'd like to know more about sources of research support on campus (travel support follow up)
          * Undergraduate research programs
          * Research administration

  11. The literature review: science's background check
    - What is research?

  12. How to get started with research
    - What is research?
    - Failures: don't try to fail, but you know... Live with it!

  18. Meeting with a professor
    - Set the agenda or it will be set for you

  15. Going from (class) project to paper

  10. How to give a talk
    - On jokes
    - The hour structure (45 min)
    - The 15 min structure
    - The 3 min structure
    - Tips
      * Never finish your talks asking if anyone has questions
      * Don't go back and forth on slides like a crazy person (repeat the slide)
      * Never show complicated algorithms and equations, especially if they're too small to read!
      * Saying more or more complicated words doesn't make you look smarter 
      * You're not allowed to cop out of answers by saying things like "I'm a mathematician, I don't know about the apps"
        or "I'm an app guy, the math is not my thing"
      * No one cares about whether that's your thesis or PhD
      * No video is fun enough for you to show without commenting it
    - On being at a conference:
      * Don't assume you know what people are talking about: most likely you don't
      * Walking into an ongoing conference talk


  16. Getting into a PhD program (in the US)
    - Emailing professors
    - Masters or not?
    - Choosing your advisor
    - Choosing your school

  17. Getting a postdoc
    - Emailing professors
    - Choosing your advisor
    - Choosing your school
    - Set the agenda or it will be set for you

  19. Banned words/expressions
    - Folklore: it is often used to express "commonly accepted belief" or "famous anecdote" rather than "traditional result." Only the latter is acceptable.
    - Anecdote: the collective of "anecdote" is not "data"
    - Hope: it either does or does not, there is no hoping. Worst offenders: "hope for robustness"; "in the hope that it will lead to better performance"
    - Believe: your beliefs are not relevant for science
    - Should: do or do not, there is no try (Yoda)
    - Prove/show/demonstrate (when referring to experiments): unless they are exhaustive (which is not the case), experiments (at best) suggest/indicate/illustrate
    - Flat minima: see folklore

  6. 25 things you're doing that are sabotaging your career
    - Refuse to celebrate the success of others or the community
    - Unwilling to evolve: "it was better in the 60s"
    - Live presentation should be spontaneous
    - You think that because you're good, someone else should do the work
    - Marketing my music isn't cool
    - Someone else will have your best interest in mind
    - You're a dick
    - You're unreliable
    - Don't know how to build authentic relationships
    - You expect overnight success
    - Never asking for help
    - You have no direction or goals
    - Assuming everyone reads your specific journal (it's more scattered!)
    - Keep reworking old stuff
    - Not focusing on releasing papers
    - Can't take criticism
    - You don't admit that something is not working
    - Your stuff is so unique that it's indescribable, never done before, I don't need to cite all these people

  2. The review process (from both sides)
    - What is peer-review?
    - Where does peer-review come from?
      - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_peer_review)
      - [f1000](https://blog.f1000.com/2020/01/31/a-brief-history-of-peer-review/)
      - [SA](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-birth-of-modern-peer-review/)
      - [Spier, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167779902019856)
    - What is peer-review for?
    - Should I be reviewing papers? How many?
    - The characters
      - The authors
      - The editor
      - The reviewers
    - Current issues with peer-reviewing:
      - Too many papers, too little time
      - Focus on ideas and novelty
      - No one teaches "peer-reviewing"

  3. The review process (the reviewer's side)
    - How to become a reviewer?
    - What is the goal of peer-review?
      - Correctness
      - What peer-reviewing is *not* about:
        - Whether the paper should be accepted
        - Whether the paper is good (but it is about whether it is relevant)
        - Whether the paper is novel (with an asterisk)
          - [blog on novelty](https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/news/novelty-in-science)
        - Whether the paper cites X or Y
      - The reviewer is not a bouncer that should only let the cool kids in
    - How to review a paper?
      - Read the paper
      - Quick lit check (if need be)
      - Check problem formulation
      - Check results, but don't forget to also...
      - **Check proofs**
      - Check experiments
      - Check references
      - [ACS reviewing tips](https://acsoncampus.acs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ACSonC_10tips_peer-review_Poster.pdf)
    - Make the editor's life easy

  4. The review process (the author's sides)
    - How to read reviews?
      - Twice: first to vent, then to learn
    - The types of reviewers
    - The types of reviews: [fortress](https://matt.might.net/articles/peer-fortress/)
      1. pointless: cite this...
      2. move the paper sideways: compare to this, more sims...
      3. improve the paper: clarifications, proof suggestions, some references...
      4. detrimental: muddy the waters, outside the scope, alternative problem formulation...
    - How to reply to reviewers?
      1. complain, but just do it
      2. just do it
      3. definitely do it!
      4. don't do it
    - The reply method
      - Copy the reviews
      - Breakdown into issues
      - Start every response with "The reviewer has a point"
    - Do's and Don't's
      - Do be cordial
      - Don't apologize
      - Do be topical: address the specific reviewer's point and not your own prejudice of what they might mean
      - Don't pander
      - Do be precise and specif
    - Remember that reviewers are people that often learned to review by reading bad reviews!
    - Make the editor's life easy

  11. Proof techniques
    - [Tao, p. 210](https://web.archive.org/web/20121014175436/http://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf)
    - [epsilon of room](http://www.tricki.org/article/Create_an_epsilon_of_room)
    - GRaVy: This stands for "Generalizations", "Refinements" and "Variations" and this one word
      represents the way that 80% of day-to-day mathematics (and mathematical science,
      including statistics and computer science) gets created. The paradigm needs no modification
      in mathematical statistics, and the story for applied statistics requires only small modification.
    - Start with something simple, then go "mine" for opportunities --Steele

  13. How to get into a new field
    - Go write a book on it
    - Goals
      - Goal 1: understand the underlying problem of the field
      - Goal 2: understand the approaches
      - Goal 3: determine the issues with the state of affairs
      - Goal 4: understand the solutions
    - Get 3 papers, read the intro and look at the references
      - Something keeps popping up: go read it (and look at the references)
      - Something is stated as fundamental: go read it (and look at the references)
      - Something looks familiar: formalize the parallel
    - A field is a problem, an approach, and many solutions
      - Good try: change each of these
        - Problems: these are often hard to change. The field has accepted problems
          and often the problem defines the field. But sometimes certain small modifications
          make sense (different assumptions...). Be wary of making random modifications:
          if you don't know the field, you might just go turn the problem into one that makes no sense!
        - Approach: this is very nice. Fields are often stuck on specific approaches to solve problems.
          Different approaches have different advantages/disadvantages, so it's always good when walking
          into a new room to see if your typical pick-up lines would land. Might requiring tweaking the
          problem.
        - Solutions: sometimes (often) practical solutions are approximations of the actual ones. Sometimes
          these are great approximations, sometimes there's room for improvements. If you come from a
          "tool field," it's worth looking into whether your known solutions would fit here. That means
          mapping current problems to others or abstracting them. Again, this might require a change
          in problem and approach, but it's worth looking into. Be wary of just trying to use your
          hammer on a screw! This is an interesting thing to try, but requires some finesse...
    - GRaVy: This stands for "Generalizations", "Refinements" and "Variations" and this one word
      represents the way that 80% of day-to-day mathematics (and mathematical science,
      including statistics and computer science) gets created. The paradigm needs no modification
      in mathematical statistics, and the story for applied statistics requires only small modification.
    - Combining ideas: sometimes, Idea 1 in the field can be combined with Idea 2 in your field to get
      Idea 3 that isn't covered either of the original ones and is extremely interesting.

  14. How to be a chair
    - The job of the chair
      - Before the talk
        - Gather information on format (questions before/after, length), location, requirements
        - Gather speaker's bios (or just name/paper title)
        - Prepare questions
      - Right before the talk
        - Make sure every speaker is in the room (conference)
        - Introduce themselves to speaker, check name pronunciation, check bio
        - Check/communicate format: preference with respect to questions
      - During the talk
        - introduce speaker
        - manage crowd (questions)
        - manage speaker (time)
      - After the talk
        - Return presentation checklist to conference?
    - Introducing the speaker: name pronunciation, bio
    - Hosting in the virtual world: questions during or after?
    - When things go wrong
      - Stopping/interrupting an overlength speaker
      - Putting a stop to an interrogator


# DONE

8. Latex rules
  - Use `~`
  - Use `%`
  - The `-`, `--`, `---`
  - Do not say "equation (X)" (unless that's your field)
  - Do not start lines with math symbols
  - Do not start sentences/lines with equation numbers or references
  - Use the `\cite[]{}` and cite specific sections/theorems
  - Indent!

5. Get a website... Now!
  - What is it for?
  - What to have on it?
    - Picture
    - Papers
    - CV
    - Bio
    - Contact informations: email, office address
    - Links: google scholar, github, twitter? (certainly not instagram, facebook)
  - Other ideas
    - Research description
    - Personal
    - Teaching
    - Blog?
  - Do people really look into it? Not really... Still, have one!
  - What about twitter, youtube, snapchat, tiktok...?

9. How to write math
  - Theorem, explanation, proof
  - Not a fan of the "informal statement": theorems are formal, explanations need not be (but still, stick to the facts!)
  - Always interpret and contextualize results
  - Explain what you're gonna do, do it, explain what you've done
  - NO LONG CHAINS OF EQUATIONS/INEQUALITIES: be verbose!
  - Try to avoid dealing with the arcane math terminology: just define things! (don't do like wiki)
  - Always be specific about what you're referencing (no "the previous equation," "the inequality above")
  - [Halmos](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lind/Resources/Halmos.pdf)

  > Sloppy presentation is simply NOT ACCEPTABLE. If your presentation is not professionally executed,
    it is almost impossible to tell if your arguments are correct. Bizarrely enough, it's just like Mother said:
    "Neatness counts!" When the time comes to write real (publishable!) papers,
    you'll find huge benefits to knowing how to write your proofs clearly and honestly.

  > As I remind myself of what Rick has written, I note that he has a little tendency to prove a more general result and then collect simpler (more natural!) results as corollaries. For for example, he does the WLLN for triangular arrays before he does it for IID sequences.  
  > I'd coach you to go the other way.  
  > State the simplest version of the "theorem" that makes sense and prove that version first. Then look at your proof to see if you can extract from your proof: (1) a more general or (2) more precise version of your theorem.  
  > I'd speculate that most "general theorems" are just simple theorems followed by some conscientious "proof mining". It's not a bold claim to assert that is the way that the world came to most of its collection of general results. Hilbert said that the path to mathematical discovery was through those examples that carry the germ of generality.  
  > If you are interested in making your own contributions, I'd say that the "simple" to "general" path is the only way to go. The only caveat is that the words "simple" and "general" have many layers of interpretations. At this point --- why not take the simplest!  
  > Look at the look at Tao's note on concentration. Tao's view of the Hoeffding inequalities was very instructive to me. I had Hoeffding in my head as a "convexity result" and I was honestly surprised to see that a useful version could be had by a crude Taylor series method. This is obvious once seen, but I never asked myself the question: "Can I just get by with an expansion?" By golly, the next time I see some convexity proof, I will ask myself that question.  
  > The great benefit of a crude method is that it tends to be very robust. Tao's approach to Hoeffding makes inevitable the inequalities of Bennett and Bernstein (coming soon to a class room near you).  
  > PS: There may not be any real ordering of ideas from complex to simple. It's certainly open to discussion whether a convexity argument is more fundamental than a Taylor series argument. Much of the time I'd side with convexity as being the simpler.As they say in the negotiations classes: "Why not both?" The two methods have robustness of differing kinds, so "proof mining" can lead from them in different directions.
