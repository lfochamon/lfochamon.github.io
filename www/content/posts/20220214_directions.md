I've been thinking about starting a blog for a while now, but I didn't really know
what to write about. There are already thousands of technical blogs out there,
covering every niche topic I could imagine. Many of them are even pretty good!
So I wasn't very enthusiastic about the idea of starting yet another one of those
blogs to talk about my research (which, believe it or not, is already being discussed
in my [papers]({filename}/pages/publications.md)!).

Recently, however, I started working with a new group of students and I noticed that
they had essentially the same questions as my previous students as they were
starting out. Not just that, but a vast majority of their topics are not technical
(I am lucky I get to work with people who know how to do their thing) and lack good
resources. They are about other aspects of research, such as how to deal with the logistics
of academia, how to overcome the struggles of academic life, what goes on behind the
scenes of professional research... These are the things I want to try and address
in this blog (at least for the time being).

**My goal is to provide information and guidance on important, yet not so commonly discussed aspects of science and academia.**

Obviously, these subjects are not clear cut: there are many *good* ways to approach these issues
(perhaps as many as there are researchers) and I'm not claiming to have any definitive answers.
These are *my* opinions, *my* way of doing things. They're not necessarily good or bad. They're just *mine*.
So while I hope that these ideas will be helpful to you, you should take them with a grain of salt.
And if you think you know a better way, do not hesitate to [let me know](mailto:{{SITEEMAIL}})!
I'm always looking for ways to do things more effectively, efficiently, and/or correctly.

That being said, here is an official disclaimer I can point to when someone inevitably comes
to shout at me for spreading bad advice. You have been warned!


## Disclaimer

### What this blog is about
  * How *I* work (and perhaps why)
  * How *I believe* things should be (and perhaps why)
  * How *I believe* things should be done (and perhaps why)


### What this blog is *not* about
  * How *you* should work
  * How *you* should do things
  * How to be *successful* (whatever that means) in academia
  * How to improve your *technical skills* (if it happens, it's by accident)
