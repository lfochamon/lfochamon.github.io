title: Get a website... now!

summary: Don't read this post, just go get/update your website!
status: draft


You'd be surprised how many PhD students (and occasional professor!) don't have websites. In 2022!
Or they have one from when they applied to graduate school and have never updated it since. Same
thing happens to more seasoned academics. Think of the name of 10 senior professors in your
field and go check out their websites: at least one will have a picture of themselves from over 20
years ago... non-ironically.

If an email is your address online, a website is your home. Better yet, it's your storefront.
It's what you show people walking down this big shopping mall we call "science" so they come in
and buy your product (papers). It doesn't matter that you just started, have no research topic,
haven't written a papers yet. Just get a website!

My goal in this post is to go over why and how you can get an (academic) website.
In a [follow-up post](#), I'll cover its content.


## Why do I need a website? I want to be a scientist, not a rock star

Nowadays, you can't get by without an online presence. People need (or want)
fast access to information and if you are not there to deliver it, they'll go
look for it something else. You are not worth tracking down. In fact, no one is.
I don't mean that you need to be on the latest social media platform. You don't
have to TikTok every arXiv upload... [yet](#). But having a website is sort of
the lower bar for any 21st century professional. It doesn't have to be fancy,
it doesn't have to be shiny. It should be clear, organized, and easy for you to
manage.

Do academics really look at other academics' websites? To be honest, not really...
Over the course of February 2022 ([Figure 1](#)), my website received roughly 300
views from 120 users, 80% of which were new user (many of which, I'm guessing, bots).
I picked this month because I didn't give any talks or released paper. So these are
just the views you would expect to get on a day-to-day basis. But in general, you will
only really see academics looking at your websites if

  1. they see your name and have no idea who you are: they'll Google you to go over
    the titles of your papers see if you're worth their time;
  2. you are about to give or are giving a talk: again, they'll look for keywords in
    your paper titles to refresh their memory on who you are, see what you're about,
    and/or try to come up with a good question before you even start talking.
    Your host/chair will be chasing your formal bio so they can introduce you;
  3. they have to meet with you: again, they'll be looking for a quick snippet of who you
    are so they know what to talk about (although some more spontaneous souls that enjoy
    being surprised by life might prefer *not* to prepare for meetings);
  4. they are looking for a specific paper and they believe will be faster to find it in
    your website than on Google (not a commonly upheld belief).

Indeed, you can see in [Figure 1](#) that essentially a third of visitors went to
check my papers ("Publications"), 20% checked my research summary ("Research"),
17% looked at my professional bio ("About"), and 10% cared about who I am outside
of work ("Personal"). Something I didn't expect is that the engagement time actually
tells a very different story: visitors spent more time on the research summary and
personal page than reading my bio or scrolling through my list of publications.
The formal bio has only 5 views, but the longest engagement time (most likely
because of item 2 above).

So while researchers don't just randomly go through professional
websites just to check up on what their peers have been up to,
there are still plenty of good reason to have a nice storefront
out there for these moments.

## How to get a website?

### Domain name and hosting

To have a website you need two things: a domain name (your website's address, the URL)
and a host (the location where your website files are). Most major institutions
will provide you with both and there's good reason for you to use it: it's free and
you get a URL that has your institution name on it. It's not gonna be a nice `yourname.com`
thing, but the institution name helps give your website an air of credibility.
Get in touch with your IT department and find out how to set it up: they probably
have an FAQ online with step-by-step instructions.

Sometimes, however, you find yourself in a tougher situation. At UC Berkeley,
for instance, websites and domain names are managed by the departments. But even though
I am a UC Berkeley postdoc, I am attached to the Simons Institute that, for
complicated ($$$) administrative ($$$) reasons ($$$), is not a department.
The solution: asking nicely to someone from IT. They'll tell you about a
student-run organization on campus (the [Open Computing Facility](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/))
that provides free domain and web hosting space to anyone on campus
(they do much more than that, but that's all I needed).

Other times you find yourself in an even tougher situation. Back when I was doing my
undergrad and masters at the [Polytechnic School](#) of the [University of S&atilde;o Paulo](#), Brazil,
there was no infrastructure in place for students to have websites (email was being
phased in when I joined). It was tricky even for professors (every lab had their own setup)!
My understanding is that things run much smoother now.

None of these are excuses to not have a website. There are plenty of free hosting
services out there, just go pick one and move on!


### The actual website

Once you get a domain name and host, you'll need to actually create your website.
Don't overthink this! Get a template, fill it up, and upload it. You can fix it,
change it, redesign it as you go. But you need a website **now**!

Most institutions will only allow you to have static pages (`.html`).
Do you need to learn HTML? No. Should you? It doesn't hurt, but probably not.
I would recommend you set up a "static site generator" with a template that doesn't
hurt your eyes and move on. You can find a million on Google, but again:
don't overthink it. Check out [Pelican](#), [Hugo](#), and [Jekyll](#), look at
some short tutorials, see if there's a template you like, and choose the one you
think will be easier to use.

Some institutions (e.g., those that use the Google suite), give you access to
a site builder, WordPress, or something of the genre. There you can create your
site from scratch, using their templates and drag-and-drop. While it might be easier
than learning HTML, CSS, and web design just to build your website, these platforms
typically have more options than you will ever need (support for comments,
picture carousels, pop up modals asking your users to subscribe to your mailing list).
Resist the temptation of using these features to procrastinate getting your website online.
Less is more!

Whichever route you take, the most important thing is that your website be easy to
update. You will need to constantly add new papers, announcements for talks, courses
you've taught. If you find yourself thinking "it's gonna take me 10 minutes to add this,
I'll do it later," then you need to switch systems. Your website is not a one-time thing.
It takes maintenance and you should account for the cost of doing that.
