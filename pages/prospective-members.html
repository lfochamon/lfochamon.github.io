<p>My group designs systems to extract, process, and act on information using tools from
optimization, signal processing, control, learning, and probability (not always all of them, not necessarily all at once).

<div class="highlight">
<p>I am currently looking for people interested in joining my group as a PhD student next year at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">École Polytechnique</a> to work on topics at the intersection of optimization, learning, control, and statistics.</p>
<p>Projects in my group are typically at the interface of theory and practice, so there is room for those more mathematically-inclined as well as those more empirically-inclined. While all of my students are expected to know and do a bit of both, there are opportunities for you to position yourself along a wide range of the theory/math–practice/coding spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Deadline</strong>: applications are accepted on a rolling basis (the position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found).<br/>
<strong>Target starting date:</strong> Fall 2025 (flexible)<br/>
<strong>Salary:</strong> 2300 € gross (<a href="#so-how-much-is-my-salary-exactly">How much is that?</a>)  </p>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<h4 id="why-pursue-your-phd-here">Why pursue your PhD here?</h4>
<p>At the École Polytechnique (also known as X) and CMAP, you have access to a world-class research infrastructure and support, including high performance computing clusters. You also have the opportunity (and means) to interact with leading scientists from a variety of fields; sit on seminars from noteworthy researchers from around the world; and attend major conferences. X is part of the <a href="https://www.ip-paris.fr/">Institut Polytechnique de Paris</a>, among the 50 best universities world-wide and #2 in France (<a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/institut-polytechnique-de-paris">QS rank</a>). Located on the Plateau de Saclay, it is surrounded by world-class institutions (such as INRIA, Telecom Paris, CentraleSupélec, ENSAE, HEC), industrial research centers (such as Danone, Thales), and a vibrant start-up community.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the French doctorate system at <a href="https://www.campusfrance.org/en/what-involved-Doctorate-France">Campus France</a>. If you have any questions about the positions, the PhD in general, and/or life in France, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:l%75%69%7A.c%68a%6Don@si%6D%74ech.u%6E%69-stuttgart.d%65?subject=[App PhD]">reach out</a>.</p>
<h4 id="so-how-much-is-my-salary-exactly">So how much is my salary exactly?</h4>
<p>PhD student minimal salaries are defined nationally by the government. You can easily find <em>gross</em> values in the
<a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/article_jo/JORFARTI000046820748">law</a>. <em>Net</em> salaries are harder to determine
as they depend on your tax situation. In an informal poll of <em>net</em> salaries among PhD students, I got to something
in the range of <strong>1700–1800 €</strong> (which is consistent with what you get on <a href="https://www.salaire-brut-en-net.fr/">this</a> website). These are unofficial estimates and therefore come with the typical caveat on internet sources. It is worth noting that PhD students in France are contracted, full-time employees entitled to the all social benefits of traditional public sector employment, including sick days and paid time-off (holidays).</p>
<p>Again, if you have any questions about the positions, the PhD in general, and/or life in Paris, do not hesitate to
<a href="mailto:l%75%69%7A.c%68a%6Don@si%6D%74ech.u%6E%69-stuttgart.d%65?subject=[App PhD]">reach out</a>.</p>
<h4 id="do-i-need-to-speak-french">Do I need to speak French?</h4>
<p>The answer is a resounding <strong>NO</strong>. The official and working language of the group is English.
Additionally, many courses are offered in English and most of the university staff speaks English.</p>
<p>Now, <em>should</em> you speak French? Probably eventually. Even if Paris is a highly international city, speaking French will definitely make your life easier and more fun outside of the university. And if you are going to spend multiple years in a country, you might as well learn the local language. If you do decide to give French a try, there are plenty of French language courses and resources at and around the university, many of them free of charge.</p>

<h2 id="master-thesis">Master thesis</h2>
<p>My group does not have Master project calls open at the moment. However, feel free to <a href="mailto:l%75%69%7A.c%68a%6Don@si%6D%74ech.u%6E%69-stuttgart.d%65?subject=[App Master]">get in touch</a>
if you are interested in writing your Master thesis with us (include <code>[App Master]</code> in your subject line).
We work on a variety of exciting topics upon which your Master project can be based.</p>
<p>Master projects typically combine the use of a novel optimization, control, or statistics tool with a practical machine learning or signal processing
application. We expect interested students to have a strong theoretical background and/or be good programmers as well as being able to come up with
fresh ideas for challenging research problems. Thesis topics are primarily for students currently enrolled at École Polytechnique.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="student-assistant">Student assistant</h2>
<p>My group does not currently have student assistants calls open. However, we are always looking for motivated students interested in
collaborating in our projects. Feel free to <a href="mailto:l%75%69%7A.c%68a%6Don@si%6D%74ech.u%6E%69-stuttgart.d%65?subject=[App SA]">reach out</a> to discuss if you are interested in working with us
(include <code>[App SA]</code> in your subject line). Student assistant positions are primarily for students currently enrolled at École Polytechnique.</p>
