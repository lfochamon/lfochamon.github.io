<div class="highlight">
<p>I am currently looking for people interested in joining my group as a PhD student to work on topics at the intersection of optimization, learning, and statistics.
Example projects include, but are certainly not limited to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Science-constrained learning</li>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<h4 id="why-pursue-your-phd-here">Why pursue your PhD here?</h4>
<p>At the University of Stuttgart and SimTech, you have access to a world-class research infrastructure and support,
including high performance computing clusters and scientific data infrastructures. You also have the opportunity
(and means) to interact with leading scientists from a variety of fields; sit on seminars from
noteworthy researchers from around the world; and attend major conferences.</p>
<p>On the (not-less-important) logistic side, while Germany is known for its bureaucracy,
the requirements for PhD positions here are actually quite straightforward. In particular,</p>
<ul>
<li>you are <em>not</em> required to take German language exams, TOEFL, GRE, or pay application fees;</li>
<li>there are <em>no starting date</em> restrictions: you can begin your PhD year-round;</li>
<li>you have the opportunity to take courses, but are <em>not</em> required to do so;</li>
<li>there are <em>no teaching</em> requirements;</li>
<li>PhD programs tend to be shorter (3-4 years), though this is not a rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you enjoy several benefits, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>competitive <a href="#so-whats-the-salary-exactly">salary-to-cost-of-living ratio</a>;</li>
<li>full-time employment by the university that entitles you to social benefits,
  including healthcare, family assistance, and 30 days of paid time-off (holidays);</li>
<li>fully-funded opportunities to attend conferences;</li>
<li>opportunity for a fully-funded international research stay (as an ELLIS-SimTech PhD).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about the positions and/or life in Germany, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:l%75%69%7A.c%68a%6Don@si%6D%74ech.u%6E%69-stuttgart.d%65?subject=[App PhD]">reach out</a>.</p>
<h4 id="so-whats-the-salary-exactly">So what's the salary exactly?</h4>
<p>It turns out that exact <em>net</em> salaries are not straightforward to evaluate in Germany. PhD student salaries are negotiated nationally by the
worker's association and while the government lists all values <a href="https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/tv-l/allg/">here</a>,
how much you actually get paid depends on things like qualifications, years of academic experience, tax bracket...
But after a short poll of <em>net</em> salaries among PhD students, I got to the number <strong>2300 €</strong> (which is consistent with
<a href="https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/allg?id=tv-l&amp;g=E_13&amp;s=1&amp;zv=VBL&amp;z=100&amp;zulage=&amp;stkl=1&amp;r=&amp;zkf=&amp;kk=15.5%25">this tier</a>).
How far does that get you? The same short poll revealed that it is more than enough and a quick Google search estimated the cost of living 
in Stuttgart at <strong>900-1800 €</strong> (e.g., <a href="https://housinganywhere.com/Stuttgart--Germany/cost-of-living-stuttgart">link</a>,
<a href="https://livingcost.org/cost/germany/bw/stuttgart">link</a>, <a href="https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/stuttgart">link</a>,
or <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Stuttgart">link</a>). Yes, it's a large bracket, but it depends on too many factors to narrow down,
such as your living standards, whether you rent a room or an apartment, where...</p>
<p>It is worth noting that PhD students in Germany are full-time employees of the university entitled to social benefits
(healthcare, pension plans, family assistance, etc.), sick days, and 30 days of paid time-off (holidays) per year.</p>
<h4 id="do-i-need-to-speak-german">Do I need to speak German?</h4>
<p>The answer is a resounding <strong>NO</strong>. The official and working language of the group is English (the same holds for ELLIS and SimTech).
Additionally, the vast majority of graduate course are offered in English and most of the university staff speaks English.
I myself do not currently speak German and I'm surviving.</p>
<p>Now, <em>should</em> you speak German? Probably eventually. Even if Stuttgart is a highly international city (more than 25% of its
population has a foreign passport), speaking German will make your life easier and more fun outside of the university.
And if you are going to spend multiple years in a country, you might as well learn the local language. If you do decide to
give German a try, the university and the city offer a variety of German language courses and resources, many of them free of charge.</p>

<h2 id="master-thesis">Master thesis</h2>
<p>My group does not have Master project calls open at the moment. However, feel free to <a href="mailto:l%75%69%7A.c%68a%6Don@si%6D%74ech.u%6E%69-stuttgart.d%65?subject=[App Master]">get in touch</a>
if you are interested in writing your Master thesis with us (include <code>[App Master]</code> in your subject line).
We work on a variety of exciting topics upon which your Master project can be based.</p>
<p>Master projects typically combine the use of a novel optimization, control, or statistics tool with a practical machine learning or signal processing
application. We expect interested students to have a strong theoretical background and/or be good programmers as well as being able to come up with
fresh ideas for challenging research problems. Thesis topics are primarily for students currently enrolled at University of Stuttgart.</p>

<h2 id="student-assistant">Student assistant</h2>
<p>My group does not currently have student assistants calls open. However, we are always looking for motivated students interested in
collaborating in our projects. Feel free to <a href="mailto:l%75%69%7A.c%68a%6Don@si%6D%74ech.u%6E%69-stuttgart.d%65?subject=[App SA]">reach out</a> to discuss if you are interested in working with us
(include <code>[App SA]</code> in your subject line). Student assistant positions are primarily for students currently enrolled at University of Stuttgart.</p>
